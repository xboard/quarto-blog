    "text": "Interrupted Time Series (ITS)\nInterrupted time series (ITS) is a method of statistical analysis involving tracking a period before and after a intervention at a known point in time to assess the intervention‚Äôs effects within a single group/population. The time series refers to the data over the period, while the interruption is the intervention, which is a controlled external influence or set of influences. Effects of the intervention are evaluated by changes in the level and slope of the time series and statistical significance of the intervention parameters [2]. The more observations you have before and after the intervention, the more robust your model will be (typically). Because the evaluation is based on observing a single population over time, the ITS design is free from problems due to between-group difference but are susceptible to time-varying confounders like other interventions occurring around the time of the intervention that may also affect the outcome [3].\n  \n\nüëç Strengths of Interrupted Time Series include the ability to control for secular trends in the data (unlike a 2-period before-and-after \\(t\\)-test), ability to evaluate outcomes using population-level data, clear graphical presentation of results, ease of conducting stratified analyses, and ability to evaluate both intended and unintended consequences of interventions.\nüëé Limitations of Interrupted Time Series include the need for a minimum of 8 time periods before and 8 after an intervention to evaluate changes statistically, difficulty in analyzing the independent impact of separate components of a program that are implemented close together in time, and existence of a suitable control population.\n\nIn mathematical terms, it means that the time series equation \\((1)\\) includes four key coefficients:\n \\[Y = b_0 + b_1T + b_2D + b_3P + \\epsilon\\] \nWhere:\n\\(Y\\) is the outcome variable;\n\\(T\\) is a continuous variable which indicates the time passed from start of the observational period;\n\\(D\\) is a dummy variable indicating observation collected before (\\(D=0\\)) or after (\\(D=1\\)) the intervention;\n\\(P\\) is a continuous variable indicating time passed since the intervention has occurred (before intervention has occurred \\(P\\)is equal to \\(0\\));\nWith \\(\\epsilon\\) representing a zero centered gaussian random error.\n\nCounterfactual\n  \n\nWhat would have happened had Neo chosen the blue pill?\n\nIn an ITS it is important to understand the counterfactual. The counterfactual refers to what it would have occurred to Y, had the policy intervention not happened.\n\nüìùCounterfactuals are simply ways of comparing what happens given a change, versus what should have happened had some change not occurred in the first place.\n\nIn a randomized trial or A/B test we know the counterfactual average outcome because the experiment withheld the intervention from the control group (which by randomization is somewhat the same as the intervention group). A critical assumption in ITS is that the outcome of interest trend would remain unchanged in the absence of intervention."

Our statsmodels OLS summary output shows a Prob(JB): 0.369 which for a standard \\(\\alpha\\) level of 0.05 doesn‚Äôt allow us discard null hypothesis (\\(H_0\\)).\nLet‚Äôs plot the distribution of residuals:\n    res.resid.plot(kind=\"kde\")\n\n  \n\nWhich for a small dataset (less than 50 points) looks sufficiently gaussian.\nOverall, the assumption of normality of residuals can‚Äôt be convincingly refuted. ‚úÖ\n\n\nChecking independence of observations:\nThe Durbin-Watson statistic test if the residuals are correlated with its immediate predecessor, that is, if they have an autocorrelation at lag 1 or \\(AR(1)\\). Its value ranges from 0 to 4 and values smaller than 1.5 indicate a positive autocorrelation, while values greater than 2.5 signal a negative autocorrelation.\nIf we take a look again at our OLS summary output we will observe that the Durbin-Watson statistic has a value of 0.665 which signals a strong positive \\(AR(1)\\).\nLet‚Äôs plot the residuals to see if we can observe this autocorrelation:\nimport altair as alt\n\nrules = alt.Chart(pd.DataFrame({\n  'residuals': [0.0],\n  'color': ['black']\n})).mark_rule().encode(\n  y='residuals',\n  color=alt.Color('color:N', scale=None)\n)\n\nresidual_plot = alt.Chart(res_df).mark_point().encode(\n    x=alt.X('Weeks'),\n    y=alt.Y('residuals')\n)\n\nrules + residual_plot \n\n  \n\nNotice how residuals above/below zero have most points temporally close to it also above/below zero as well, which goes against the independence of observations assumption of OLS ‚ùå.\n\nüìùIn practice when analyzing time series data the presence of autocorrelation is the rule instead of the exception since in general the factors that contributed to a given observation tend to persist for a while."

    "text": "Autoregressive model solution\nThe autoregressive model specifies that each observation depends linearly on previous observations.\nThus, an autoregressive model of order \\(p\\) (\\(AR(p)\\)) can be written as\n \\[y_t = c + \\phi_1 y_{t-1}+ \\dots + \\phi_p y_{t-p} + \\epsilon_t\\] \nWhere:\n\\(y_t\\): observation at time \\(t\\),\n\\(y_{t-i}\\): observation at time \\(t - i\\),\n\\(\\phi_i\\): coefficient of how much observation \\(y_{t - i}\\) correlates to \\(y_t\\),\n\\(\\epsilon_t\\): white noise ( \\(\\mathcal{N}(0, \\sigma¬≤)\\) ) at time \\(t\\).\n\nAutocorrelation\nTo assess how much an observation correlates with past observations it is useful to do an autocorrelation plot as shown below:\nsm.graphics.tsa.plot_acf(res.resid, lags=10)\nplt.show()\n\n  \n\n\n\nPartial Autocorrelation\nThe partial autocorrelation at lag \\(p\\) is the correlation that results after removing the effect of any correlations due to the terms at shorter lags.\nsm.graphics.tsa.plot_pacf(res.resid, lags=10)\nplt.show()   \n\n  \n\n\n\nModel selection\nThe theory states that in an autoregressive model its autocorrelation plot should depict an exponential decay and the number of lags \\(p\\) should be taken from the partial autocorrelation chart using its \\(p\\) most relevant lags. Applying the theory to our plots above, we conclude that our model is autoregressive of lag 1 also known as AR(1).\n\n\nARIMA\nIn statistics ARIMA stands for autoregressive integrated moving average model and as can be inferred by the name AR models are as especial case of ARIMA therefore AR(1) is equivalent to ARIMA(1,0,0).\nWe can model an AR(1) process to our dataset using statsmodels ARIMA as below:\nfrom statsmodels.tsa.arima.model import ARIMA\n\narima_results = ARIMA(df[\"Y\"], df[[\"T\",\"D\",\"P\"]], order=(1,0,0)).fit()\nprint(arima_results.summary())\nOutput:\n                               SARIMAX Results                                \n==============================================================================\nDep.

As the Prob(Q): 0.32 is way above the standard \\(\\alpha = 0.05\\) there is no evidence of serial autocorrelation in the ARIMA residuals. ‚úÖ\nLet‚Äôs now take a look at residuals qqplot to check if they follow a normal distribution:\n\nimport scipy as sp\nfrom statsmodels.graphics.gofplots import qqplot\n\nfig, (ax1, ax2) = plt.subplots(1,2, figsize=(16,8))\nsm.qqplot(res.resid, sp.stats.t, fit=True, line=\"45\", ax=ax1);\nax1.set_title(\"OLS qqplot\");\n\nsm.qqplot(arima_results.resid, sp.stats.t, fit=True, line=\"45\", ax=ax2);\nax2.set_title(\"ARIMA qqplot\");\nplt.show();\n\n  \n\nWe may observe that the ARIMA(1,0,0) model residuals not only are in general normally distributed as they fit better than the OLS model the theoretical quantiles. ‚úÖ"

    "text": "Summary\nA/B tests are a the most powerful and trustworthy method to do measure the impact of modifications/changes even before they are fully implemented, which is why they are so widely used.\nHowever, there are some scenarios where A/B tests are not feasible and this is when the knowledge of quasi-experiments becomes valuable to get statistically sound measurements of change impact.\nIn this post we have shown why an ordinary least square (OLS) linear regression is not a good modeling approach for time series data since they usualy present non-negligible autocorrelation that violates some assumptions of OLS.\nWe demonstrated with an example how to use python (statsmodels, matplotlib, altair and pandas) to visualize residuals and plot autocorrelation and partial autocorrelations charts to figure out the lag of an autoregressive model and then implemented a ARIMA model using statsmodels to observed a more accurate and precise analysis and how to interpret statsmodels model output for OLS and ARIMA.\nWe also showed how to plot in a single chart the models estimates (mean and 95% confidence interval) for the time periods before and after intervention and its respective counterfactual."
