Hey ðŸ‘‹, I am Flavio Regis de Arruda.

I am a backend and data engineer who resides in Brazil ðŸ‡§ðŸ‡·. With over 20 years of experience in backend and data science, I have cultivated a great passion for managing, manipulating and analyzing data in order to gain better insights and ultimately improve the world.

In my free time, I enjoy spending time with my two children, playing chess, traveling and watching movies. As I believe in the importance of maintaining a balance between work and personal life, I make sure to incorporate daily exercise into my routine. Additionally, I like to walk in nature at least once a week to recharge my energies.
