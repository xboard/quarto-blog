## Why?


### What is quarto?

Quarto offers the promise of being a cross-platform, cross-format, open source publishing tool based on pandoc.

## Installing Quarto

Go to the [get started](https://quarto.org/docs/get-started/) page on the quarto website to download the installer file. I’m on Ubuntu, so for me that’s a .deb file. I install it from the command line:

```bash
sudo dpkg -i quarto-1.3.433-linux-amd64.deb

```

Create my blog project, called `quarto-blog`:

```bash
quarto create-project quarto-blog --type website:blog

```
then enter the project and preview it:

```bash
cd quarto-blog/
quarto preview quarto-blog
```
