## Why

In a [post published on September 3, 2022](https://forums.fast.ai/t/fastpages-deprecating-fastpages-in-favor-of-quarto/99095), Hamel Husain announced that he has rebuilt nbdev on top of [Quarto](https://quarto.org). In the blog post, he explained that there have been new pieces of technology like [Jupyter Book](https://jupyterbook.org/) and [Quarto](https://quarto.org), which are both fabulous. Husain explained that he ended up using Quarto for nbdev, because of its shared vision with nbdev and the fantastic ongoing support from JJ Allaire and the rest of the Posit team. He also recommended that people trying to blog with notebooks should be using Quarto, instead of Fastpages.

## Installing Quarto

Go to the [get started](https://quarto.org/docs/get-started/) page on the quarto website to download the installer file. I’m on Ubuntu, so for me that’s a .deb file. I install it from the command line:

```bash
sudo dpkg -i quarto-1.3.433-linux-amd64.deb

```

Create my blog project, called `quarto-blog`:

```bash
quarto create-project quarto-blog --type website:blog

```
then enter the project and preview it:

```bash
cd quarto-blog/
quarto preview quarto-blog
```
